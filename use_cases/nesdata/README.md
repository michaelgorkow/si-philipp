In addition to that we also have unstructured data for marketing campaigns, customer contracts, financial reports and product specifications.

## What makes questions hard?

This demonstration goes far beyond simple Text-to-SQL or RAG use cases. Let's examine what happens behind the scenes when you ask the following question:

> **"Which products were featured in the Summer Hydration campaign and how did their individual sales perform during the campaign? Visualize sales in a line plot."**

![Example_Question](_resources/agents_example_question.png)

### 1. Document Analysis
The agent first identifies that this question requires finding the relevant PDF containing information about the marketing campaign, including which products were included.

It discovers the following products:
- **PureLife Natural**
- **PureLife Sparkling** 
- **PureLife Flavoured**

It also recognizes that the campaign is run between **June - August 2022** which it correctly translates into the right filter criteria for the SQL query.

### 2. Complex SQL Generation
With the products and campaign period identified from the PDF document, the agent creates a sophisticated SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    t.month_name,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(s.total_revenue) AS monthly_sales
FROM
    cortex_agents_demo.finance_food_beverage.sales s
    INNER JOIN cortex_agents_demo.finance_food_beverage.products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    INNER JOIN cortex_agents_demo.finance_food_beverage.time_periods t ON s.period_id = t.period_id
WHERE
    p.product_name IN (
        'PureLife Natural',
        'PureLife Sparkling',
        'PureLife Flavored'
    )
    AND t.year = 2022
    AND t.month IN (6, 7, 8)
GROUP BY
    t.month_name,
    t.year,
    p.product_name
ORDER BY
    t.month_name DESC NULLS LAST,
    p.product_name;
```

### 3. Intelligent Name Matching
**Note:** The product names from the PDF are not identical to those in the dataset. Did you notice the difference?

- **PDF**: "PureLife Flav**ou**red"
- **Database**: "PureLife Flav**o**red"

The agent handles this discrepancy by utilizing [Snowflake's Cortex Search integration for Semantic Models](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/cortex-analyst-search-integration), which enables dynamic retrieval of relevant literals using hybrid search (combining lexical search with embedding search).

### 4. Visualization Generation
Finally, the agent generates the requested chart using the `data_to_chart` tool that is available to all agents by default.
